This model takes in the input of CGPA and IQ of a student and tries to decide if the student wil get Placement!
This model was traineed on a small dataset and yielded an accuracy score of 100%. Yay!

*Ofcourse, the input features are not enough in deciding the placement factor in real world.
This is a self learning project and does not reflect real world.
Thank You!
Have a Nice Day!
